    <p>This is a sample paragraph to demonstrate the HTML structure.</p>
    <div><p>CSS attributes, also called CSS properties, are used to control the 
        appearance and layout of HTML elements on a webpage. They allow developers
         to change styles such as color, font size, background, margins, padding, borders,
          alignment, and much more. By applying these properties, we can make a website visually 
          appealing and easier to read. For example, the color property changes the text color, font-size 
          controls how big the text appears, text-align sets the alignment of content, and  margin or padding adjust spacing. CSS attributes help separate design from content, making webpages well-structured, attractive, and easier to maintain.lorem*2
